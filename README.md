TASK1-CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES 
Building a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. It uses if-else statements to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. 
This gives us a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow. 

TASK2- TIC-TAC-TOE AI 

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search
algorithms.

TASK4- RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to
users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.
